# Fave Foods
This ios gets the users current position and populates a list of nearby restaurants by using the popular Foursquare api. Users can then swipe to save places to their favorites list.

This app uses react natives built in async storage to store data locally to the users device. This allows for saved places to be shown even when there is no internet connection.
